    "text": "Tree water use and drought responses: the roles of allometry, water storage and transport under climate change\nThese traits have been typically measured in terminal branches or leaves but how they coordinate and scale at the whole plant level is not well understood. Because whole-plant traits can behave very differently from tissue-level traits, it is essential to advance our understanding of how whole-plant hydraulic properties vary both globally and at the local scale. In addition to this variability, tall trees vary dramatically in their properties along their vertical axis.\nTerrestrial laser scanning TLS, allows accurate 3D reconstructions of tree architecture and can be used to upscale tissue-level traits to obtain whole-plant hydraulic properties. These properties can also be estimated from detailed physiological monitoring at the tree level, which provides a link with existing global datasets of tree and ecosystem water fluxes. This project will combine global databases with novel in situ datasets to test the following hypotheses: a) whole-tree hydraulic conductance and capacitance vary at the global scale as a function of climate, plant functional type and tree properties, b) in large mature trees of three Mediterranean species, water use responses to a severe experimental drought are determined less by vulnerability to embolism of their terminal branches than by the drought response of the entire tree, and c) bark and leaf capacitance control the early phases of water potential declines during drought, while xylem capacitance and residual evaporation losses control the later phases.\nTo achieve this, we will expand a global dataset of tree water use, SAPFLUXNET, that we created and are maintaining. We will estimate whole-tree capacitance and conductance by combining SAPFLUXNET with water potential data and we will compare these values with hydraulic traits of leaves and stems.. We will then establish a rainfall-exclusion field experiment on mature trees of three species, one pine and two oak species (one evergreen, one deciduous)in a Mediterranean forest. We will monitor tree water use, water content and water potentials over a 2-year period in leaves, branches and stems. Using TLS, we will determine the 3D architecture of our trees and will integrate tissue- and organ-level traits to quantify changes in whole-tree hydraulic capacitance and conductance as a function of species, treatment and season. A new analytical model will be parameterised for our trees to quantify the relative importance of allometric properties and tissue-specific traits in determining differences in whole-plant water use across species and in response to imposed drought.\nThe results of this proposal will contribute to improve our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of tree drought responses at local to global scales, and will therefore appeal to the scientists in the areas of functional ecology and global change biology. Besides, the results and methodologies in this proposal will be of interest for forest managers and for the wider public interested in the effects of global change on Mediterranean forests."

    "text": "Increased drought in the context of climate warming will impact the structure, composition and functioning of the vegetation. The main objective of this project is to improve the ability to predict vegetation responses to drought stress and climate warming, taking into account different functional dimensions, intra- and interspecific variability of traits and their coordination at different scales. These issues will be addressed through global database analysis, community-level field sampling along environmental gradients and drought simulation experiments.\nIt is expected that the increase in drought in the context of climate warming will impact the structure, composition, and function of vegetation across many regions, with significant feedback effects on key ecosystem services, including climate regulation. Forecasting these changes under different climate change scenarios has become a key goal of contemporary research in ecology and conservation science. Functional traits (i.e., measurable morphological, physiological, or phenological features at the individual level that affect demographic rates and fitness) provide a natural basis for predicting vegetation responses to environmental changes. However, most studies have found that the predictive power of commonly measured traits is low.\nBased on recent developments in trait-based ecology, we propose that the predictive power of traits could be improved by: (i) Measuring traits more closely linked to relevant physiological processes. (ii) Considering whole-plant trait coordination, corresponding functional modules or syndromes, and the evolutionary constraints underlying this coordination. (iii) Accounting for environmental context (e.g., stress exposure) and trait variability at different scales, including within species.\nWe argue that two key functional dimensions, typically overlooked but critical to understanding and predicting vegetation responses to climate warming, are:\nDrought tolerance traits, including resource allocation and hydraulic architecture. Metabolomic features, associated with both primary and secondary (specialized) metabolism.\nObjectives The main goal of this proposal is to improve the ability to predict vegetation responses to drought stress and climate warming, considering different functional dimensions, trait variability, and their coordination across scales. Specifically, we will address the following questions:\nHow are traits from different functional dimensions coordinated across species, and to what extent does this coordination reflect evolutionary constraints? How does trait coordination differ among species from distinct communities along an environmental gradient of water availability, and how is it related to their demography and biogeographic context? How does trait coordination change among populations across a water availability gradient spanning an entire species distribution? Does it differ from coordination at higher levels of organization? How is it linked to stress responses?\nActions These questions will be addressed through three complementary approaches:\nAn analysis of existing global databases, focusing on patterns among woody species (WP1). A community-level study in dry shrublands along an environmental gradient of water availability (WP2). A common garden experiment including populations from the entire distribution range of a model species and their response to experimental drought (WP3)."
